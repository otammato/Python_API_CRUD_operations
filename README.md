# Python_REST_API_CRUD_operations

We create a Products's list using a Flask server. Your application should allow you to add a product, retrieve the products, retrieve a specific product with its id, update a specific product with its id, and delete a product with its id. All these operations will be achieved through the REST API endpoints in your Flask server.

You will create an application with API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on the above data using a Flask server.

You will use cURL and POSTMAN to test the implemented endpoints.



- Create API endpoint to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on transient data with a Flask server.
- Create REST API endpoint, and use POSTMAN to test your REST APIs.
